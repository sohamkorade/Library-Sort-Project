# Library Sort

## Description

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort.

Library sort is a modification of insertion sort that gains speed by trading space. It is also known as gapped insertion sort.
